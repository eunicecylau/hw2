# Requirements/assumptions
#
# - There will only be three movies in the database â€“ the three films
#   that make up Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.
# - Movie data includes the movie title, year released, MPAA rating,
#   and studio.
# - There are many studios, and each studio produces many movies, but
#   a movie belongs to a single studio.
# - An actor can be in multiple movies.
# - Everything you need to do in this assignment is marked with TODO!
# - Note rubric explanation for appropriate use of external resources.

# Rubric
# 
# There are three deliverables for this assignment, all delivered within
# this repository and submitted via GitHub and Canvas:

# - Generate the models and migration files to match the domain model from hw1.
#   Table and columns should match the domain model. Execute the migration
#   files to create the tables in the database. (5 points)

# - Insert the "Batman" sample data using ruby code. Do not use hard-coded ids.
#   Delete any existing data beforehand so that each run of this script does not
#   create duplicate data. (5 points)

# - Query the data and loop through the results to display output similar to the
#   sample "report" below. (10 points)

# Delete existing data, so you'll start fresh each time this script is run.
# Use `Model.destroy_all` code.
Movie.destroy_all
Studio.destroy_all
Role.destroy_all
Actor.destroy_all

# Generate models and tables, according to the domain model.
# rails generate model Movie
# rails generate model Studio
# rails generate model Role
# rails generate model Actor

# at migration files, add columns

# rails db:migrate

# check schema

# Insert data into the database that reflects the sample data shown above.
# Do not use hard-coded foreign key IDs.
# TODO!
